    // since the information content of moved nodes is the same across
    // the table, we share this information
    //
    // safety: next_table is a valid pointer if it was read as consequence of loading _this_
    // table as `map::HashMap.table` and reading a BinEntry::Moved while still holding the
    // guard used for this load:
    //
    // When loading the current table of the HashMap with a guard g, the current epoch will be
    // pinned by g. This happens _before_ the resize which put the Moved entry into the this
    // table finishes, as otherwise a different table would have been loaded (see
    // `map::HashMap::transfer`).
    //
    // Hence:
    //
    //   - When trying to access next_table during the current resize, it points to
    //     map::HashMap.next_table and is thus valid.
    //
    //   - After the current resize and before another resize, `next_table == map::HashMap.table`
    //     as the "next table" it pointed to during the resize has become the current table. Thus,
    //     next_table is still valid.
    //
    //   - The above is true until a subsequent resize ends, at which point `map::HashMap.tableÂ´ is
    //     set to another new table != next_table and next_table is `epoch::Guard::defer_destroy`ed
    //     (again, see `map::HashMap::transfer`). At this point, next_table is not referenced by the
    //     map anymore. However, the guard g used to load _this_ table is still pinning the epoch at
    //     the time of the call to `defer_destroy`. Thus, next_table remains valid for at least the
    //     lifetime of g and, in particular, cannot be dropped before _this_ table.
    //
    //   - After releasing g, either the current resize is finished and operations on the map
    //     cannot access next_table anymore (as a more recent table will be loaded as the current
    //     table; see once again `map::HashMap::transfer`), or the argument is as above.
    //
    // Since finishing a resize is the only time a table is `defer_destroy`ed, the above covers
    // all cases.
