    // entry was read after loading `map::HashMap.table` while the guard used to load that table is
    // still alive:
    //
    // When loading the current table of the HashMap with a guard g, the current epoch will be
    // pinned by g. This happens _before_ the resize which put the Moved entry into the current
    // table finishes, as otherwise a different table would have been loaded (see
    // `map::HashMap::transfer`).
    //
    // Hence, for the Moved(t) read from the loaded table:
    //
    //   - When trying to access t during the current resize, t points to map::HashMap.next_table
    //     and is thus valid.
    //
    //   - After the current resize and before another resize, `t == map::HashMap.table` as the
    //     "next table" t pointed to during the resize has become the current table. Thus t is
    //     still valid.
    //
    //   - The above is true until a subsequent resize ends, at which point `map::HashMap.tableÂ´ is
    //     set to another new table != t and t is `epoch::Guard::defer_destroy`ed (again, see
    //     `map::HashMap::transfer`). At this point, t is not referenced by the map anymore.
    //     However, the guard g used to load the table is still pinning the epoch at the time of
    //     the call to `defer_destroy`. Thus, t remains valid for at least the lifetime of g.
    //
    //   - After releasing g, either the current resize is finished and operations on the map
    //     cannot access t anymore as a more recent table will be loaded as the current table
    //     (see once again `map::HashMap::transfer`), or the argument is as above.
    //
    // Since finishing a resize is the only time a table is `defer_destroy`ed, the above covers
    // all cases.
