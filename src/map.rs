                    //     treeification to happen after the insert while still holding the lock, the

                    //     (since the bin we inserted to _just_ passed the threshold right before the
                    //     move).
                    //       If we instead try to treeify after the releasing the lock, and due to
                    //     scheduling the move happens first, it is fine for us as the first thread to
                    //     see the `Moved` when we re-check here and just not treeify the bin. If either
                    //     of the two bins in the new table (after the bin is moved) is still large
                    //     enough to be above the `TREEIFY_THRESHOLD`, it will still get treeified in
                    //     the _new_ table with the next insert.
                    //   BinEntry::Tree(_):
                    //     In the same scenario of trying to treeify _outside_ of the critical section,
                    //     if there is one insert passing the threshold there may then be another insert
                    //     before the first insert actually gets to do the treeification (due to
                    //     scheduling). This second insert might also get to treeifying the bin (it will
                    //     try because it sees a regular bin and the number of elements in the bin is
                    //     still above the threshold). When the first thread resumes and re-checks here,
                    //     the bin is already treeified and so it is again fine to not treeify it here.
                    //       Of course there is a tradeoff here where the second insert would already have
                    //     happend into a tree bin if we forced the first thread to treeify while still
                    //     holding the lock. However, the second thread would then also have to wait for
